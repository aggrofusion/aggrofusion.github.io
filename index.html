    <div id="About Me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> In my free time, I enjoy watching live streams on twitch.tv or playing video games. My main games of focus right now are
            Dragon Ball Fighterz and Dota 2, which I have been playing since 2013. I also enjoy reading manga with my favorite series being JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. If I have
            some extra spending money lying around, I greatly enjoy commissioning artwork of my favorite characters.<br>
            The most important thing to me is growth as a person and a computer scientist. During my first internship as a member of an End User Support team, I was
            learning new stuff every day which was an amazing feeling. The most important thing I learned from that intership was what to learn in the future. My co-workers suggested
            Database Management among other topics which have all interested me greatly.<br>
            This is a field I know I can spend a career working in. I get very easily sucked into my work and can have hours fly by as I'm coding or working on anything.
            I hope to become the laid back old CS professor at your college that somehow knows everything.

        <p> I am currently a Junior at Monmouth University with a 3.84 GPA. Important courses I have taken include Database Systems (CS-432) and Data Structures(CS-205).
            In the spring semster of 2020 I will be taking Operating Systems (CS-438) and Information Systems Project Management (IT-450) which will have us work for a client
            and create a website of their choosing. I plan on graduating in Spring 2021. <br>
            I have worked as the IT Intern at Robertet Flavors from May 2019 to August 2019, and have been invited back to help through January 2020. My role as an IT Intern at
            the Piscataway branch of the company was to assist the current IT Deparmentk employees in the day-to-day activities such as handling support tickets. 
            I also assisted in the ongoing Windows 10 Migration project and helped to close it out before my departure. My duties in that project included setting up
            laptops and desktops with the Robertet Windows 10 image, retrieving and decommissioning old laptops/desktops, and creating Standard Order Procedures for 
            ongoing processes.</p>
