        <p> I am currently a Junior at Monmouth University with a 3.84 GPA. Important courses I have taken include Database Systems (CS-432) and Data Structures(CS-205).
            In the spring semster of 2020 I will be taking Operating Systems (CS-438) and Information Systems Project Management (IT-450) which will have us work for a client
            and create a website of their choosing. I plan on graduating in Spring 2021. <br>
            I have worked as the IT Intern at Robertet Flavors from May 2019 to August 2019, and have been invited back to help through January 2020. My role as an IT Intern at
            the Piscataway branch of the company was to assist the current IT Deparmentk employees in the day-to-day activities such as handling support tickets. 
            I also assisted in the ongoing Windows 10 Migration project and helped to close it out before my departure. My duties in that project included setting up
            laptops and desktops with the Robertet Windows 10 image, retrieving and decommissioning old laptops/desktops, and creating Standard Order Procedures for 
            ongoing processes.</p>
